# AI Agent Customer Collaboration

## Human-Agent-Customer Dynamics

### Role of Human Facilitators
- Human facilitators primarily serve as **translators** between customers and AI agents
- The facilitator's role shifts from solution creator to communication bridge
- Facilitators may experience reduced sense of ownership over solutions due to agent effectiveness

### Agent Performance in Customer Interactions
- AI agents demonstrate ability to create **near-perfect solutions** when working directly with customer problems
- High success rates observed, with agents frequently achieving optimal results on first attempt ("one shotting gold")
- Solutions are delivered with remarkable **speed**
- Direct customer engagement appears to enhance agent solution quality

### Source of Innovation
- **Customer-driven ideation**: The creative ideas and problem definitions originate from customers themselves
- Customers provide the conceptual framework and requirements
- Agents execute on customer-provided ideas rather than generating solutions independently

### Collaborative Workflow
1. Customer identifies problem and provides context/ideas
2. Human facilitator translates customer needs to agent
3. Agent creates solution based on customer input
4. High success rate achieved through this collaborative approach
