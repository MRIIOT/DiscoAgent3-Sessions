# Discord Knowledgebase System

## System Architecture

### Purpose
- Automated **Discord conversation knowledge extraction** system
- Creates structured knowledgebase from Discord channel conversations
- Converts conversational content into organized Markdown documentation

### Technical Implementation
- **Session identification**: Uses serverid-channelid naming pattern for organization
- **GitHub integration**: Sessions stored in MRIIOT/DiscoAgent3-Sessions repository
- **Automated workflow**: Continuous operation with periodic GitHub updates

## Operational Workflow

### Runtime Schedule
1. System initiated and began operation (started previous night)
2. **Continuous processing** throughout operational day
3. **Batch updates** to GitHub repository at end of cycle
4. Session data organized by Discord server and channel identifiers

### Data Organization
- **Session naming convention**: `{serverid}-{channelid}` format
- Each session represents knowledge extracted from specific Discord channel
- Sessions maintained as separate entities for organizational clarity

### Repository Structure
- **GitHub repository**: [MRIIOT/DiscoAgent3-Sessions](https://github.com/MRIIOT/DiscoAgent3-Sessions)
- Centralized storage for all captured conversation sessions
- Version control for knowledge evolution and updates
