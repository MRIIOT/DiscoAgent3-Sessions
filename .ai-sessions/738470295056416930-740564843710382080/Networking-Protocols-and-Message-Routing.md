# Networking Protocols and Message Routing

## Zenoh Protocol

Zenoh is a networking protocol/technology that can be used for message routing and communication systems.

### Current Limitations
- **Message Routing Layer Constraints**: The current message routing layer in Zenoh only understands key ownership concepts
- **Custom Implementation Requirements**: Any functionality beyond basic key ownership requires custom implementation on top of the core protocol
- **Architectural Challenges**: These limitations create challenges for more advanced messaging patterns and routing strategies

### Alternative Solutions
- **User Agent (UA)**: Mentioned as a potential alternative that developers might adopt instead of building custom solutions on top of Zenoh

### Future Outlook
There appears to be ongoing development and potential improvements planned for Zenoh's routing capabilities, though current limitations require workarounds for complex messaging scenarios.
