# Hardware Debugging and Recovery

## BIOS and Firmware Issues

### BIOS Flashing Mishaps
- **Data Corruption**: Directory listings or filesystem data can accidentally be written to BIOS instead of proper firmware
- **Recovery Challenges**: Corrupted BIOS creates system boot failures requiring specialized recovery tools

### Recovery Tools and Techniques

#### Bus Pirate
- Hardware debugging tool used for low-level system recovery
- Capable of interfacing with BIOS chips for recovery operations
- Essential for situations where standard recovery methods are unavailable

## Common Hardware Recovery Scenarios
- **BIOS Corruption**: Firmware flashing errors requiring hardware-level intervention
- **Boot Failures**: System recovery when software-based methods are insufficient
- **Hardware Interface Debugging**: Direct chip-level access for system restoration
