# Virtualization and Hypervisor Strategies

## Bare Metal Hypervisor Implementation

### Core Concept
- Running hypervisor directly on bare metal hardware
- Multiple operating systems hosted as virtual machines
- Alternative approach to traditional single-OS installations

### Technical Architecture
- **Main Driver VM**: Primary virtual machine with device passthrough capabilities
- **Secondary VMs**: Additional operating systems (including Windows)
- **Remote Access**: Remote Desktop connectivity to secondary VMs

### System Management Benefits
- **Simplified Reformatting**: Easier system restoration and reconfiguration
- **OS Flexibility**: Ability to run multiple operating systems simultaneously
- **Hardware Optimization**: Better hardware resource utilization through virtualization

### Device Passthrough
- Direct hardware access for main driver VM
- Maintains performance for primary workload
- Isolation between different operating system environments

## Advanced Virtualization Solutions

### Qubes OS
- **Application-Level Isolation**: Each application runs in its own isolated VM
- **Seamless Integration**: VMs are hidden from user; applications appear to run directly on desktop
- **Security Architecture**: Enhanced isolation compared to traditional virtualization
- **User Experience**: Maintains familiar desktop workflow while providing VM-level security

### VM Selection and Management
- **Hardware KVM Comparison**: Similar concept to hardware KVM switches for computer selection
- **OS Wrapper Approach**: Operating system that primarily manages and presents virtual machines
- **Transparent Virtualization**: Advanced abstraction where underlying VM infrastructure is invisible to end users
