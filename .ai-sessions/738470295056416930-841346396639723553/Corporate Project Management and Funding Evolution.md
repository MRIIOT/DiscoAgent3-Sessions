# Corporate Project Management and Funding Evolution

## Overview
This document captures knowledge about how project management and funding processes evolve in corporate environments, particularly the transition from experimental freedom to structured board governance.

## Key Insights

### Evolution Timeline
- **Past (5+ years ago)**: More experimental freedom, ability to try new approaches without formal approval
- **Present**: Structured governance with board-level project approval and funding allocation

### Current Corporate Structure
- Projects require board-level approval
- Funding flows from board decisions down through organizational hierarchy
- More predictable funding but less experimental flexibility

### Organizational Size Impact
- **Small Organizations**: Direct reporting to CEO/President enables faster approvals
- **Leadership Support**: CEO actively facilitates project approval processes
- **Proactive Leadership**: Executives may initiate structured processes rather than impose them
- **Quality-Driven Evolution**: Structured processes often emerge as response to quality issues and corrective action needs

### Trade-offs in Organizational Maturity

#### Advantages of Structured Approach
- Reliable funding streams
- Strategic alignment with organizational goals
- Better resource allocation
- "Good place to be" from stability perspective
- Addresses quality issues through systematic oversight
- Enables corrective action tracking and implementation

#### Disadvantages of Structured Approach
